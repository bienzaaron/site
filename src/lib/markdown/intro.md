Hey! I'm AJ. I'm a software engineer and general computer nerd, currently living in Richmond, VA and employed at Capital
One.

This is my little corner of the internet. Feel free to click around to find more about me, read some of my partially-coherent ramblings, and even download my resume if you are interested in hiring me. ğŸ˜±
