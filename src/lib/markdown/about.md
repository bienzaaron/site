# About Me

Hey, there! Thanks for checking out my site. I'm a full-stack software engineer, currently employed at Capital One and living in Richmond, Virgina with my wife, dog, and two cats.

My technical interests include systems programming and embedded systems (although, I don't get to work on that sort of technology much in a professional capacity these days). For work, I work with TypeScript and Node.js quite a lot, and also work on some vanilla JS web frontend stuff. I don't do a whole lot of frontend application development or design work, but I'll do it if you twist my arm - I always try to find tooling that makes it as easy as possible though. For example, this site is mostly written in markdown, and almost all of the styles come from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). More about how this site is built over on my [blog](./blog).

When I'm not writing code, I can usually be found sipping on a cup of coffee or pursuing one of my many hobbies. I enjoy camping, backpacking, fishing, and just generally anything that gets me outdoors - bonus points if I can bring my pup with me! I'm also an avid woodworker, motorcyclist, home mechanic, and general tinkerer. Lately I've also been juggling a few home renovation projects/ I always have a project going on (or more realisitically, several), so you'll never find me without something to work on. You can check out my [blog pages](./blog) to find our more about my projects and hobbies.
