# About Me


Hey, there! Thanks for checking out my site. I'm a full-stack software engineer, currently employed at Capital One and living in Richmond, Virgina with my wife, dog, and two cats.


My technical interests include systems programming and embedded systems (although, I don't get to work on that sort of technology much in a professional capacity these days), backend and distributed systems, serverless, and software design and architecture. I'm not much into frontend and design work, but if you twist my arm, I'll do it. You can bet I'll find and use the latest and greatest tools to avoid the "design-ey" parts of that process though - for example, this site is mostly written in markdown, and almost all of the styles come from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). More about how this site is built over on my [blog](./blog).


When I'm not writing code, I can usually be found sipping on a cup of coffee and pursuing one of my many hobbies. I enjoy camping, backpacking, fishing, and just generally anything that gets me outdoors - bonus points if I can bring my pup with me! I'm also an avid woodworker, motorcyclist, home mechanic, and general tinkerer. I always have a project going on (or more realisitically, several), so you'll never find me without something to work on. You can check out my [blog pages](./blog) to find our more about my projects and hobbies.
